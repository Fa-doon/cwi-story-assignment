    <h1>A Programmer's Journey So Far</h1>
    <h2>First Experience</h2>

    <!--Making use of paragraph tags-->

    <p>My journey with <strong>Code With Imole</strong> started on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January, 2022. Prior to the commencement date, we convened to set out the structure for how to go about our bootcamp. I particularly liked how our facilitators; <b>Peter</b>, <b>Imoleayo</b>, and <b>Afolasope</b> were warm and always addressed us as <em>Family Members</em>. We concluded on the days and time for meet-up and review sessions and materials/resources were and are still being sent to us.</p> 
    <p>Throughout January, we touched theoritical aspects that introduced us to programming. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed with the numerous terminologies and struggled to get a grasp of some of the concepts. As I went over them again, they started to make more sense than the first time. Subsequently, I was able to keep up and also meet deadlines for our tests. We have also been advised that we can't possibly know everything but what we can do is to read through recommended documents and also look up things on <a href="https://www.google.com"> Google</a> </p>

    <h2>The Current Phase</h2>
    <p>We just started learning the pratical aspect; <i>the coding part</i>, and I am super excited. I hope to put in my best effort and make the best use of this opportunity.</p>
    <p>I can't wait to see what my journey will be like in the next 3-6 months. I am also learning to be more accountable, meet deadlines, be more interactive and play my part as a <i>family member</i>.</p>
